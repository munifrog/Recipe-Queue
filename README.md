## Introduction

Android app that searches for recipes, saves favorite links, and sends
ingredients to a shopping list.

## Overview

The app contains the following Activities:
 * A shopping list
 * A search-query-creating activity
 * A display of search results

## Getting started / Usage

The files for this project were built using Android Studio, so you will likely have the easiest
time duplicating the original behavior using the same.

1. Obtain an API key from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard)
1. Obtain (or perhaps re-use) an application ID from [AdMob](https://apps.admob.com/v2/home) > _Apps_ > _Ad Units_ > _Add Ad Unit_
1. Clone this repository
   * `git clone https://github.com/munifrog/Recipe-Queue.git`
1. Open the _RecipeQ_ directory using Android Studio
1. Copy _my.keys.sample_ to _my.keys_ (in the same directory)
1. Edit _my.keys_ with values for _api\_spoonacular_ and _ad\_mobs\_application\_release_ as respectively obtained earlier
   * Note that a release build would also require a definition for _ad\_mobs\_interstitial\_release_
1. Save _my.keys_
1. Launch the app on an emulator or a physical device

## License

This started as a capstone project for the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)
and I own the rights for the project idea, although there are alternatives out there.

While I personally prefer indirect sources for finding solutions to puzzles, you may learn from
what I have done, if that helps. Just be careful to avoid plagiarism if you are also taking this
course and looking for answers.

If, on the other hand, you want to build on what I have done, that is also welcome.
